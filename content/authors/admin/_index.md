As of today, I can divide my research interests into three broad categories: (1) the evolution of sales with respect to technology, (2) bottom of the pyramid marketing, helping those who are in global social crisis with innovative marketing campaigns and techniques and (3) the salespersonâ€“customer dyadic relationship. 

I plan to work, research, and produce knowledge in these (or other) categories in the years to come.
It is the research element that drives my passion for the doctoral program. As a sales and marketing student, the classroom setting for me has always brought excitement, and a sense of discovery as new knowledge is presented to young professionals looking to make a difference in this world. But it is the research aspect that will fulfill my desire to solve the questions that life continuously refuses to answer.
