Zmich Consulting LLC is a small, independently owned marketing consulting company that prides itself on honesty, transparency, and dedication to making your business perform the best online. I pride myself on learning the ins and outs of online brand management and social media guidance to provide you and your business the tools needed to be seen by your customers. The bottom line is, if your business is not online, you don't exist. However, only "being online" is not enough anymore. Companies are forced to optimize their business by using tools like Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, and Google Ads to the best of their ability. Businesses must optimize their advertising to be seen by customers at the right time. Not to mention having a cohesive brand image on all social media platforms, so people know what you offer and how you can benefit their lives. 

All of these tools can be overwhelming. You're a business owner, and as such, time is a scarce resource. That's where I come in. I will work with you and be your digital consultant, making sure your business is seen by the customer that matters to your bottom line while making sure you know how to optimize your business's strategy and mission best. I have worked with both the [Ruston Farmers Market](https://www.rustonfarmersmarket.org/) and [Holly Creek Farm](https://hollycreek.farm/) to optimize their online presence and ensure proper Google search engine optimization (SEO). In addition to these working experiences, I have been plugged into the social media space for over five years now. As an intern, I worked alongside the Northern Illinois University's College of Business and helped maximize their social media potential. Lastly, I am a self-taught website designer, and with the help of R-Studio and Hugo Themes, I designed and coded this very website you are on now. 

I look forward to working with you and your business soon. Thank you for visiting.
