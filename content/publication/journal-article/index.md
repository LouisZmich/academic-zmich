abstract: Touch is the least studied sense in marketing research (Peck & Childers, 2008; Krishna, 2011). 
Our sense of touch, however, plays a crucial role in healthy emotional, social, and physical 
development and is our earliest and most fundamental form of nonverbal communication 
(Gallace & Spence, 2010; Field 2010). In general, the nonverbal aspects of interpersonal 
communication (i.e., “body language) are thought of as important determinates of customers’ 
evaluations of service encounters, potentially even holding as much weight as their verbal 
counterparts (Barnum & Wolniansky, 1989; Sundaram & Webster, 2000). Service providers’ use 
of touch has been proposed to enhance customers’ perceptions of friendliness and empathy 
(Sundaram & Webster, 2000). A review of experimental studies on interpersonal touch in 
business settings can help identify the circumstances under which, and to what degree, positive 
customer responses occur. In this study, we conduct a meta-analysis to assess customers’ overall 
behavioral and evaluative responses to interpersonal touch and the influence of study-level 
differences (moderators) on these responses. This study serves to inform firms on the value and 
appropriateness of employing a personal touch with their customers and clients, and to provide a 
guide and empirical point of reference for future research on interpersonal touch. 
 
Research Question  
How strong are consumers’ behavioral responses to interpersonal touch? Do consumer 
behavioral responses to interpersonal touch vary across cultures and business settings? We 
believe these questions are especially interesting considering that society is moving deeper and 
deeper into a technological era; an era in which fewer errands and tasks involve human contact, 
diminishing our exposure to interpersonal touch. What exactly do we stand to gain and what 
exactly do we stand to lose by losing touch with other people? 
 
 
Method and Data  
We employ meta-analytic procedures, searching several databases, categorizing literature, and 
extracted data from articles that meet the necessary inclusion criteria to be included in the 
analysis. The keywords of touch, tactile, haptic, physical contact, consumer, customer, and 
employee were used to search for works that had been published as of September 2018. The 
search was set to find articles that contained any of the first four keywords in combination with 
the latter three anywhere in the text of the article. A total of seven databases were searched: 
Business Source Complete, PsychINFO, SocINDEX, Emerald Journals, Scopus, ABI/INFORM, 
and Google Scholar. After collecting relevant articles from the search results, the references of 
these articles were examined to identify further studies. A total of 113 experimental studies on 
interpersonal touch were collected. A final collection of 39 studies (36 of which are field 
studies) was deemed to be useable for the analysis. From these studies a total 59 effects, some of 
which are combined effects, were extracted across 8 outcome categories. These studies were 
published within the time frame of 1979 to September 2017 and had obtained responses from a 
total of 6348 subjects.  
 
Summary of Findings  
As the marketplace becomes increasing global, so too does our understanding of consumers’ 
behavior responses to different stimuli. One such stimulus that consumers are especially 
sensitive to is interpersonal touch. Our findings show that results from over 30 years of research 
indicate that consumers generally respond positively to being touch in various business 
scenarios, however, they respond negatively when touched by other consumers and not 
employees. Overall there is medium sized positive effect on behavioral outcomes for touch, with 
a stronger effect for consumers from European countries, some of which are especially known 
for the high acceptance of touching behaviors. Interestingly, we did not find a strong influence of 
many of the study-level differences, such as the gender make-up of the sample. Moving forward, 
in addition to behavior, consumer attitudes and evaluations could be considered in this meta
analysis as well, as many of the study included evaluations of the toucher and the firm. 
 
Key Contributions  
The first contribution of this study is systematic review, spanning over 30 years of literature, and 
meta-analysis assessing the strength of consumers’ behavioral response to being touched by 
employees and other customers in various settings: stores, sales, and services. Our second 
contribution explores how these responses are influenced by study-level differences including 
the gender and nationality of consumers. Ultimately, our objective is to provide a guide and 
empirical foundation for the research on interpersonal touch. Such information is valuable to 
practitioners in today's global marketplace when developing etiquette training programs for their 
employees. Such research could be applied to the following scenarios: salespeople being 
instructed to greet customers with a solid, confident, firm handshake; flight attendants calming 
anxious passengers with a hand gently resting on their arm; counselors, nurses, and doctors 
comforting distraught patients with a hand on their shoulder. We also shed light on the state of 
the research on the sense of touch, which, at least in marketing research, is the least studied of 
the five senses. 
   

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary:  This meta-analysis shows results from over 30 years of research that indicates 
consumers generally respond positively to being touch in various business scenarios, however, 
they respond negatively when touched by other consumers and not employees – there is medium 
sized positive effect on behavioral outcomes for touch, with a stronger effect for consumers from 
European countries, some of which are especially known for the high acceptance of touching 
behaviors.
