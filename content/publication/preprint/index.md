abstract: Salespeople are becoming an afterthought in B2B transactions. If the buying process for B2B purchasing agents were a dance, salespeople are not being invited to the "party." The 2018 Miller Heiman Group survey from CSO Insights highlights this information gap. The survey questioned 500 B2B buyers working for medium to large-sized companies and found that buyers preferred eight other resources (subject matter experts, past vendor experience, vendor websites, trade shows, peers, social networks, trade media, and web searches) before considering salespeople to solve business problems (Miler Heiman Group). So naturally, we are left with the question, "do we need B2B salespeople anymore?" We buy groceries, books, furniture, insurance, even cars without salespeople in today's highly technological world. Maybe salespeople have suffered the "Darwin effect." Maybe B2B salespeople are going extinct. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
