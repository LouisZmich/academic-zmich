<h2>Website Development</h2>

The base price of $300 gets you a basic website landing page up and running (Templates modified in R-Studio). You can choose which template you would like, and then I will tweak the code of the website to suit your needs.

A sample website I built for another client can be found [here](https://hollycreek.farm/). The website hosting platform (Netlify) is free, but if you want a custom domain name (like LouisZmich.com), you would need to purchase that domain name from GoDaddy, or another domain name website.

You can then route the traffic from LouisZmich.com to louiszmich.netlify.app/. Most domain names are around $11/year to manage. The website domain name costs would be part of the client's responsibility. After the initial purchase, any updates would need to be done by the client, or for an additional upkeep fee.
